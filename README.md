# PageRank-and-P-PageRank-implementation-for-Conference-citation-network

The dataset is from https://aminer.org/dblp_citation.

I implemented PageRank with teleport on Conference citation network and showed the top 50 conferences according to their PageRank scores. 

I also implemented P-PageRank and showed the top-10 most similar conferences to {KDD}, {ICML}, and {KDD, ICML} on the conference citation network.
